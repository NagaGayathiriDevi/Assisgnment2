        Question 1:
        Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

        Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

        Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
        Return k.

        Example 1:

        Input: nums = [1,1,2]
        Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
        Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
        It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
        Example 2:

        Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
        Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
        Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
        It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 

        Constraints:

        1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
        -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
        nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

        Question 3:
        Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

        Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

        The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
        Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
        Example 2:

        Question 5:
        You are tasked with writing a program that converts a binary number to its equivalent decimal representation without using bitwise operators or the `Math.Pow` function. You will implement a function called `BinaryToDecimal` which takes an integer representing a binary number as input and returns its decimal equivalent. 

        Requirements:
        1. Your program should prompt the user to input a binary number as an integer.

        3. Avoid using bitwise operators (`<<`, `>>`, `&`, `|`, `^`) and the `Math.Pow` function for any calculations. 
        4. Use only basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

         By dividing components into buckets according to their values, it uses the bucket sort method, which effectively reduces the sorting complexity to linear time. 
         When an array has fewer than two elements, the method adequately handles edge cases and returns 0 as needed.adding comments to clarify the purpose of each step and the logic behind the bucket sort algorithm would improve the code's comprehensibility, especially for someone reviewing or maintaining it in the future.

        Question:7
        Given an integer array nums, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return 0.

        Example 1:

        Input: nums = [2,1,2]
        Output: 5
        Explanation: You can form a triangle with three side lengths: 1, 2, and 2.
        Example 2:

        Input: nums = [1,2,1,10]
        Output: 0
        Explanation: 
        You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 2 to form a triangle.
        You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 10 to form a triangle.
        You cannot use the side lengths 1, 2, and 10 to form a triangle.
        As we cannot use any three side lengths to form a triangle of non-zero area, we return 0.

        1 <= nums[i] <= 106

        Question:8

        Given two strings s and part, perform the following operation on s until all occurrences of the substring part are removed:

        Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring part and remove it from s.
        Return s after removing all occurrences of part.

        A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

 

        Example 1:

        Input: s = "daabcbaabcbc", part = "abc"
        Output: "dab"
        Explanation: The following operations are done:
        - s = "daabcbaabcbc", remove "abc" starting at index 2, so s = "dabaabcbc".
        - s = "dabaabcbc", remove "abc" starting at index 4, so s = "dababc".
        - s = "dababc", remove "abc" starting at index 3, so s = "dab".
        Now s has no occurrences of "abc".
        Example 2:

        Input: s = "axxxxyyyyb", part = "xy"

        Explanation: The following operations are done:

        - s = "axxxyyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 3 so s = "axxyyb".
        - s = "axxyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 2 so s = "axyb".
        - s = "axyb", remove "xy" starting at index 1 so s = "ab".
        Now s has no occurrences of "xy".

        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 1000
        1 <= part.length <= 1000
